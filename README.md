# Habitable Zone

One day it will become a complex and realistic turn-based space game. As for now, it's just a prototype.

## Platforms

It should run correctly on Linux and Windows (and probably Mac, didn't tested). It is also should be possible to produce Android build, but UI is not ready for that at this point.

## Programming Language and Engine

**C# + Unity Engine**.
Might not the best tools for open-source game. Might not the fastest tools. But they're powerful and handy.

If I started the project now, I would probably have thought of more hardcore and open-source style C++ and Urho3D. But the code was written and there is no practical reason to rewrite it all. Nevertheless, one day I may find non-practical reason.

## Build

 - Clone this repo.
 - Open `/Source/HabitableZone/HabitableZone.sln` with your IDE and build the solution (preferably in release mode).
 - Open Unity project located at /Source/HabitableZoneUnity/ (you can do it simultaneously with previous step).
	 - [Optional] Open Scenes/MainMenu.scene and check if everything works.
 - In order to produce build, check out File â†’ Build Settings.
